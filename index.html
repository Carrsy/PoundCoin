<h2>
<a name="what-is-poundcoin" class="anchor" href="#what-is-poundcoin"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Poundcoin?</h2>

<p>Poundcoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Poundcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Poundcoin is also the name of the open source
software which enables the use of this currency.</p>

<p>For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Poundcoin client software, see <a href="http://coingen.bluematt.me/create.html?id=aa5d3a8d&amp;key=d073047cb775dd66d668">http://coingen.bluematt.me/create.html?id=aa5d3a8d&amp;key=d073047cb775dd66d668</a></p>

<p>Poundcoin is released under the terms of the MIT license. See <code>COPYING</code> for more
information or see <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>.</p>

<p>Poundcoin is based on Bitcoin.
Its development tracks Bitcoin's, the following information applies to Bitcoin's developemnt.</p>

<h2>
<a name="development-process" class="anchor" href="#development-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Development process</h2>

<p>Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.</p>

<p>If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Bitcoin
development team members simply pulls it.</p>

<p>If it is a <em>more complicated or potentially controversial</em> change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=bitcoin-development">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see <code>doc/coding.md</code>) or are
controversial.</p>

<p>The <code>master</code> branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags">Tags</a> are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>
<a name="testing" class="anchor" href="#testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Testing</h2>

<p>Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.</p>

<h3>
<a name="automated-testing" class="anchor" href="#automated-testing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automated Testing</h3>

<p>Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.</p>

<p>Unit tests for the core code are in <code>src/test/</code>. To compile and run them:</p>

<pre><code>cd src; make -f makefile.unix test
</code></pre>

<p>Unit tests for the GUI code are in <code>src/qt/test/</code>. To compile and run them:</p>

<pre><code>qmake BITCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test bitcoin-qt.pro
make -f Makefile.test
./bitcoin-qt_test
</code></pre>

<p>Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,
and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be
used for manual QA testing â€” a link to them will appear in a comment on the
pull request posted by <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinPullTester">BitcoinPullTester</a>. See <a href="https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts">https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts</a>
for the build/test scripts.</p>

<p>Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/">https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/</a> for how to create a test plan.</p>
